                            including IHH Healthcare and UOB Digital Banking.
                            For IHH Healthcare, I integrated essential features

                            development and deployment processes. I optimized
                            app performance and resolved critical bugs to ensure
                            stability. In the UOB Digital Banking project, I
                            worked on core modules including chat, payments, and
                            multilingual support, conducted peer code reviews to
                            uphold quality standards, wrote unit tests for
                            reliability, and performed bug fixes to improve user
                            experience. The tech stack involved Swift,
                            Objective-C, UIKit, SwiftUI, XCTest for mobile,
                            NodeJS and Angular for web, and architectural
